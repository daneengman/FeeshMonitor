# FeeshMonitor
The goal for our project was to be able to test the temperature, pH, and co2 levels of an aquarium remotely as well as to adjust the temperature by being able to control a heater remotely. We used a Raspberry Pi and GPIO pins/I2C communication to obtain these parameters and display them to a display. In order to collect analog input and to produce analog signals, we will use serial communication between an Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. We used Python programming language to code the Raspberry Pi.
